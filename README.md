# Large_endogeneity_common_shocks
Simulations for the paper 'Consistent Estimation in Large Heterogeneous Panels with Multifactor Structure and Endogeneity'
by G. Forchini, B. Jiang and B. Peng.

The file simulations-V2.R produces Tables 1 and 4

The file simulations_with_regressors_V3.R  produces Tables 5 and 8.

Can be run in R studio and simulations are done in parallel if several core are available
